# This file contains legacy dialog functions that are no longer used.
# The functionality has been moved to tab_components.py for the new tab-based interface.

# Note: This file is kept for reference but is no longer imported or used.
# All dialog functions have been replaced with tab-based equivalents in tab_components.py

# If you need the old dialog functions, they are available in components_backup.py
